Restaurant Website Html Code:-

In this I have create a complete navbar for the footer structure of the restaurant website. first then link Css and JavaScript files in html code. now we add a font awesome icon CDN link in the code because we create What Our Customers Say section on the website and we show that review with a star so we use a font awesome icon. then we create the structure of the navbar and itâ€™s very important in website because I create a responsive navbar in the project. then some simple sections of the restaurant website like what food is available and a food menu list.
